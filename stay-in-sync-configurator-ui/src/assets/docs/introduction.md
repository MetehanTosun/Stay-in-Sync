# 📘 Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Configurator UI** and **Monitoring UI**. This guide will help you understand the structure, purpose, and usage of the tools that enable efficient management and monitoring of synchronization services between various source and target systems.



## 🛠️ What is Stay-in-Sync?

**Stay-in-Sync** is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the synchronization of data across multiple systems. It provides a robust set of tools and interfaces for:
- Configuring synchronization jobs.
- Defining transformation rules.
- Monitoring data flows and system performance.
- Ensuring data integrity and consistency across distributed environments.
- Managing synchronization logic through a user-friendly interface.
- Integrating with various data sources and targets, including databases, APIs, and file systems.
- Providing real-time insights into synchronization processes.
- Enabling conditional logic and complex data transformations.
- Supporting deployment in cloud and on-premises environments.
- Offering extensibility for custom synchronization needs.

## 🔧 What is the Configurator UI?

The **Configurator UI** is a user-friendly interface that allows you to:

- Define and manage configuration files for synchronization jobs.
- Create and maintain transformation scripts for data mapping and modification.
- Set up synchronization rules and conditional logic.
- Manage source systems, target endpoints, and EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector) instances.

It acts as the central hub for configuring and deploying synchronization logic across systems.


## 📊 What is the Monitoring UI?

The **Monitoring UI** provides graphical insights and runtime metrics for all synchronization processes. It enables users to:

- Visualize data flows in a graph-based interface.
- Monitor service metrics such as request volume, execution time, and system load.
- Filter and inspect logs from individual services or the entire system.
- Debug and optimize sync behavior based on real-time system feedback.



## 🎯 Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is intended for:

- **Integration engineers** responsible for setting up and maintaining sync jobs.
- **Software developers** building or extending sync logic and scripts.
- **System administrators** deploying and monitoring synchronization services.
- **Data architects** designing and verifying data flow across systems.
